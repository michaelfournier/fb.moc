## Description

This plugin lets you switch any taxonomy to a radio-button style metabox, so users can only select 1 term at a time.

A plugin options page allows the user can select which taxonomies she'd like to switch to using the custom radio-button style metabox.

Based on the the class by Stephen Harris:
